# How to log into ifunny using this Client

## Generate and store a basic token

```ts
const client = new Client();
const BASIC = client.basic_token; // Generates a new basic token
const NEW_BASIC = client.basic_token; // Uses cached basic token
console.log(BASIC === NEW_BASIC); // true

// Logging in requires the reuse of a basic token, so you'll want to make sure to store this in a config file or as an environment variable
process.env["IFUNNY_BASIC"] = BASIC;
```

## Login with email and password

Attempting to get a new bearer for the first time will result in a captcha test being sent.\
You can solve these manually by opening the captcha url in the browser, then trying again, or you can use a service like 2captcha to solve them programatically

```ts
const client = new Client({
	basic: BASIC, // The basic token we stored when we generated it
});

client.on("login", (logged_in: boolean) => {
	if (logged_in === true) {
		console.log("The client actually logged in and retrieved a new bearer token");
	} else if (logged_in === false) {
		console.log(
			"The client successfully updated the payload without needing to get a new bearer token"
		);
	}

	console.log(client.bearer); // STORE THIS IN A CONFIG FILE

	// client is now ready to be used!
});

(async () => {
	try {
		// Login is async, but you don't have to await it
		await client.login({ email: "foo@bar.com", password: "password1234" }); // Fires 'login' when complete
	} catch (error) {
		// CaptchaError, you need to solve the captcha before you can get a bearer token
		if (error.captcha_url) {
			console.error(error.captcha_url);
		} else throw error; // NOT A CAPTCHA ERROR
	}
})();
```

After solving the captcha, you'll need to attempt to log in again, using the SAME BASIC TOKEN. Using a different basic token will return a CaptchaError again.

## Login with bearer token

Despite the misleading title, if you have a bearer token, you don't actually need to login. It will just attempt to update the payload with the cached bearer token, which is useful for verifying the client is still working like it's supposed to be.

```ts
const client = new Client({
	token: BEARER_TOKEN, // Stored bearer token
});

client.on("login", async (logged_in) => {
	console.log(logged_in); // false since bearer is already known
	console.log(client.bearer); // BEARER_TOKEN
});

client.login(); // Doesn't need to be awaited, will just fire the callback when finished
```

Or you could also do it like so

```ts
const client = new Client(); // Requests will use basic tokens until the client has a valid bearer token

client.on("login", (logged_in) => {
	console.log(logged_in); // false since bearer is already known
	console.log(client.bearer); // BEARER_TOKEN
});

client.login({ token: BEARER_TOKEN }); // Will update the cached bearer token and headers
```

# Constructing the client

The Client itself has multiple different params to pass into the constructor\
I'll go over them with you here. For the examples, I'm going to write these in TypeScript so I can give type annotations

## Quick guide

```ts
const { Client } = require("ifunnynode");

interface ClientConfig {
	basic?: string;
	primed?: boolean;
	token?: string;
	prefix?: string;
	user_agent?: string;
	client_id?: string;
	client_secret?: string;
	config?: {};
}

const CONFIG: ClientConfig = {
	basic: "156 Character string",
	primed: true, // Pass this if the basic token has already been primed
	token: "64 character string",
	prefix: "Command prefix",
	user_agent: "user agent used for requests", // Leave it alone to use the default
	client_id: "Don't mess with this unless you're sure yours is valid",
	client_secret: "Same as above",
	config: { any: "thing" },
};

const client = new Client(CONFIG);
```

### Token

```ts
/**
 * The bearer token is the auth token the client will use to interact with any profile specific requests
 * Stuff like subscribing and unsubscribing, smiling posts, commenting, etc, requires a bearer token
 */
const BEARER = process.env.IFUNNY_BEARER;

const client = new Client({
	token: BEARER,
});

client.login(); // Doesn't need any args because it was passed in the constructor
```

### Basic and primed

```ts
/**
 * BASIC is the basic token the client should use for requests
 * Very few endpoints will work with just a basic token, but featured will for sure.
 * If you're attempting a login, you'll need to store this when generated to REUSE
 */
const BASIC: string = new Client().basic_token; // Generates a new basic token

const client: Client = new Client({
	basic: BASIC,
	primed: false, // Defaults to false, if the basic token's already been primed, set as true
});
```

### Client ID and Secret

```ts
/**
 * The client id and secret are what's used to generate basic tokens via `create_basic_token` or `Client.basic_token`
 */
const CLIENT_ID = "MsOIJ39Q28"; // Default
const CLIENT_SECRET = "PTDc3H8a)Vi=UYap"; // Default

const client = new Client({
	client_id: CLIENT_ID,
	client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,
});
```

### User Agent

```ts
/**
 * The user agent used to make requests. Make sure this is valid, because it may flag your account as a bot if not.
 */
const USER_AGENT = "iFunny/7.21.2(1129846) Android/12 (samsung; SM-G996U; samsung)"; // Current default

const client = new Client({
	user_agent: USER_AGENT,
});
```

### Prefix

```ts
// This is just so you don't have to add it on your own.
// It doesn't do anything other than store the variable.
// Until a command handler is added, you'll need to manually check for prefixes
const PREFIX = "!";

const client = new Client({
	prefix: PREFIX,
});
```

### Config

```ts
// This is any additional config information you want to to store in the client
const CONFIG = {
	foo: "bar",
};

const client = new Client({
	config: CONFIG,
});
```
